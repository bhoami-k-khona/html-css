### The 3 Ways of Building Layouts

- What is Layout?
  - Layout is the way text, images, and other content is placed and arranged on a webpage.
  - Layout gives the page a visual structure, into which we place our content.
  - **Building a layout:** Arranging page elements into a visual structure, instead of simply having them placed one after another.
- Page Layout vs. Component Layout
  - Page layout is basically what we have been talking about up until this point, which is laying out the elements (the big pieces of content inside of a webpage/website).
  - On the other hand, these bigger page layouts are themselve made up of components.
  - These components themselves, need to have some kind of layout because they are made up of smaller pieces of content, which also need to be arranged in some kind of way.
- The 3 Ways of Building Layouts with CSS
  - Floats
    - The old way of building layouts of all sizes, using the `float` CSS property.
    - Still used but is getting outdated, fast.
  - Flexbox
    - Modern way of laying out elements in a 1-dimensional row without using floats.
    - Perfect for component layouts.
  - CSS Grid
    - For laying out element in a fully-fledged 2-dimensional grid.
    - Perfect for page layouts and complex components.
