### Overview of Web Design and Website Personalities

- Web Design vs. Development
  - Web designers create the overall look and feel of a website
  - Web developers implement the design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Why take design seriously?
  - Good Design
    - Creates an immediate and lasting good impression of the brand or product.
    - Makes the user trust the brand right away.
    - Increases the user's perceived value of the brand or product.
    - Gives users exactly what they were looking for when coming to the site, e.g. purchasing a product or finding information.
  - Bad Design
    - Makes users believe the brand doesn't really care about their product or service.
    - Makes the user insecure about trusting the brand.
    - Makes the brand or product seem "cheap".
    - Leaves users confused, and makes it hard for them to reach their goal.

### Web Design Rules 02: Colors

- Make the main color match your website's personality: colors convey meaning!
- Use a good color tone! Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors.
- Establish a color system
  - You need at least 2 types of colors in your color palette: a main color and a grey color.
  - With more experience, you can add more colors: accent(secondary) colors
  - For diversity, create lighter and darker "versions" (tints and shades)
- When and How to use Colors
  - Use your main color to draw attention to most important elements on the page.
  - Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or sections stand out.
  - Use colors strategically in images and illustrations
- Relations between colors and typography
  - On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background ("lighter version") for text.
  - Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten it up - if it looks heavy and un-inviting.
  - Don't make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors.
    - The contrast ratio needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (18px+)
